# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
Moon and Mountain Classification using SVM

This project was designed to implement a nonlinear classification using support vector machine algorithm. The goal was to classify two classes in which class 1 is bounded within the Moon and Mountain boundaries while class 2 rests outside of these boundaries. The following is what the classification result should exhibit.
